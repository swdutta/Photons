I often wonder how curated the internet is, given two highly relevant articles found me today. 

One is from the New York Times and the other from a site I use to frequent more often, but now only occasionally check. It paid off because I really enjoyed their post from today.

The ***[NYT piece](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/02/smarter-living/fear-of-rejection.html?algo=identity&fellback=false&imp_id=854167468&imp_id=568453181&action=click&module=Smarter%20Living&pgtype=Homepage)*** discusses risks, and not fearing rejection. The part that stood out was side projects can often distract you from making leaps in your current profession. It is really hard to find an audience/constumer with limited time to devote to a side project. Instead, it might be easier, economical, and in the end more fulfilling to direct your efforts in advancing the career you already have.

My favorite was from a ***[Pitchfork](https://pitchfork.com/features/article/listen-to-music/)*** feature on why we listen to new music given the tendency for our brain to instead seek the known. It argues that in order for art to move forward, we all must be open to having acquired tastes. The summary of the 1913 premiere of Igor Stravinskyâ€™s The Rite of Spring is worth the free admission to read.
